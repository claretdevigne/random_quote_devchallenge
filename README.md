# RANDOM QUOTE APP

## DESCRIPTION
This app show a random quote and the author. This app was developed using React JS. To maintain the states I utilized useState, to connect with the API I utilized axios. This time I don't use Redux toolkit, instead I utilized functions passed to the child components as props.

## Functionality
- Every time you load the page a new quote will be showed.
- If you click the random button in the upper right corner, a new quote will be showed.
- If you click the name of the author, the app will show you all of the quotes from this author.
- If you want to leave the list of quotes and show a new quote, click random button on the right top.
